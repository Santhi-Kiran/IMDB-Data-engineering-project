Title: End-to-End Data Engineering Project: Analyzing IMDB Movie Data
Description:
This repository showcases an end-to-end data engineering project focused on analyzing a comprehensive IMDB movie dataset. The project involves data cleaning, database management, and visualization, utilizing tools such as Alteryx, SQL Server, and Power BI.
Key components include:
Data Cleaning: Utilized Alteryx for importing, modifying data types, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
Database Management: Created a structured database in SQL Server to store and manage the cleaned dataset efficiently.
Data Analysis: Executed SQL queries to extract insights about movie ratings, genres, and directors.
Visualization: Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to present key findings, including top-rated movies and trends in movie production.
This project not only highlights technical skills but also demonstrates the ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes various attributes such as movie titles, release years, ratings, genres, directors, writers, languages, countries of production, and awards.
